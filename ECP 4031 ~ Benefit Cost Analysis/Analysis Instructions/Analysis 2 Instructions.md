# Analysis 2 Instructions

Review the 2011 BCA by Anthony Boardman and Diane Forbes entitles **A Benefit-Cost Analysis of Private and SemiPrivate Hospital Room**s, published in the *Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis* and write a critical analysis.

Though it need not be in this order, your analysis should address questions such as these:

- What was the problem or issue addressed?
- Why is the problem or issue important?
- What specific decision is to be analyzed and what are the specific alternatives considered?
- What are the major impacts of the alternative(s) considered?
- Who is effected?
- Who has standing?
- Who that might be effected did not have standing?
- How thorough was the literature review? Were there other very similar studies available, or were they working from only loosely related prior studies?
- What was their analytical approach?
- Where did they obtain the data they needed to implement their analytical approach? Are the data sources used reliable and reputable?
- How was each of the major impacts quantified and monetized?
- What were the findings?
- Was the sensitivity analysis sufficiently thorough?
- Were the findings robust, or highly sensitive to the assumptions?
- Did the perspective of the analysts seem neutral and reasonable? If not, why?
- What alternative analytical decisions could they have made? Might any of them been better?
- Did you see any potential serious problems with the analysis? If so, what are they, and why do you think they may be serious problems?
- Do you have any other interesting insights or observations about the paper?

Use a standard 12 point font, single spaced, with one inch margins.

Make sure any section headings you choose to use are self explanatory.

There is no explicit length requirement, but I suspect your paper should be 3-5pages if you do a good job. If it takes 6, that is OK. If it takes 10, you are not being sufficiently concise and on point.

 

(Note: there is an alternative assignment for those that prefer to form a group and conduct a full BCA rather than doing the three analyses described in they syllabus.)
