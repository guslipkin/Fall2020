# Analysis 3 Instructions

At this point, you have written a critique of a BCA conducted by a group of students (who received a good grade for their work) and one prepared by professional economists, and you have also spent two thirds of a semester studying BCA. You should have a reasonably good understanding of what makes a good BCA.

The third analysis paper if for you to formulate a plan for a **BCA of the move to FLEX Classes for Fall 2020 at Florida Polytechnic University**.

This must include enumeration of feasible alternatives, enumeration of possible impacts of those alternatives, consideration of standing, a plan to realistically obtain data to quantify impacts, a method to quantify and monetize impacts, and anticipation of distributional concerns. You will not actually conduct the BCA. But your plan must be sufficiently thorough that a BCA could actually be conducted according to it.

Use a standard 12 point font, single spaced, with one inch margins.

Make sure any section headings you choose to use are self explanatory.

There is no explicit length requirement, but I suspect your paper should be 8-15 pages if you do a good job. If it takes 5, or 12, that may well be OK. If it takes 25, you are not being sufficiently concise and on point. If it takes 3, you probably were not through enough.

 

(Note: there is an alternative assignment for those that prefer to form a group and conduct a full BCA rather than doing the three analyses described in they syllabus.)
